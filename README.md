# layla
A Smart Friend With Some Good Deeds. This is an AI smart assistant which is being in development under anononymous group. Layla is named after it's meaning "Night" which shows that we are night owlers. We choose to make this a private project because it hasn't reached a level which can make us standout in this world of AI Systems.

## Phase Level: 0.4 
We achived this phase on 30 January after implementing google results for giving answer to every question. to reach next level we will need to make a systems/programs which will perform diffrent tasks on the internet including downloading, surfing, managing, crawling and alot more.

## Implemented Phases
0.1 > Can talk and listen to user  
0.2 > Greetings Functions  
0.3 > Basic Converstaion i.e personal QA  
0.4 > Answer to any question  

Note: There are still alot of bugs in these previous implemented phase which will be solved as we go on in the development.

## Languages
1. Python (Scripting, Tenserflow, Numpy)
2. CPP (Hardware based systems)

## How To Run
1. Clone the repository from the github main branch...
2. Open the terminal in the directory which you just have cloned in your System
3. And write the following command in Terminal. Note: Python must be installed in your system and all the required modules must be installed
> python go_baby.py
4. To install the all the modules at one, enter the following commands in the terminal. 
This will install all the required modules in your PC. Note: It is better to install virtual environment before installing modules.
> pip install -r requirements.txt
5. You will have running CMD base AI. Make sure that your microphone is connected otherwise it will give an error.
